You will need to edit and set up some settings within ytdownloader.bat before the program will function (right click -> edit)

YTDownloader.bat is the file you will run to start the program. When editing is complete, it is recommended to create a shortcut of the
bat file and move the shortcut elsewhere if you want to move the executable.

When the download button is pressed in the interface, the title of the window will change to reflect the status of the download.
