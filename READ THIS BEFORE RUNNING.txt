You will need to edit and set up some settings within ytdownloader.bat before the program will function (right click -> edit)

YTDownloader.bat is the file you will run to start the program. When editing is complete, it is recommended to create a shortcut of the
bat file and move the shortcut elsewhere if you want to move the executable.

When the download button is pressed in the interface, the title of the window will change to reflect the status of the download.

Important: You will need python 3.10 installed. If your python is installed somewhere different than the quotes at the bottom of the program,
change the path at the bottom to correct it.
Make sure all the source files for this project are in their own folder before running.
